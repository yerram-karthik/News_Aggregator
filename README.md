# Description
News aggregator is a Django project to scrape a news website using Beautiful soup and request module and hence combination of web crawlers and web applications.Both of these technologies have their implementation in Python.

# Features
The news aggregator works in 3 steps:

1.It scrapes the news website for the articles.In this project, I am scraping a website **'www.theonion.com'**

2.Then it stores the articleâ€™s images, links, and title.

3.The stored objects in the database are served to the client. The client gets information in a nice template by clicking the 'Load news' button and select the different options available to you.The options are: Latest,Entertainment,Sports,Politics,Breaking-News
